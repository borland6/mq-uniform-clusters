# Script to poll a queue manager for demo app connections and display them as individual lines

# This is expecting to find connections from two applications:
#    amqsphac - Sample putting application
#    amqsghac - Sample getting application

# Usage:
#    connections qmgr_name <poll interval> <admin_password>

# Use different colours for the different applications
